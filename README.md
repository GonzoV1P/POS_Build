## Game description
Path of Survivors is a 3D game project with an isometric view and stylized visuals, combining elements characteristic of the action RPG, survivor and roguelite genres.

The key starting point for each gameplay session is the so-called “hideout”, where the player makes preparations for the next expedition. At this stage it is possible, among other things, to customize equipment, configure available skills and choose a destination location. Moving to the selected map is done through a special device, allowing quick transfer of the character to the selected game area.

Each time the gameplay starts from the 1st level of the character. With the elimination of waves of enemies, the player accumulates experience points, resulting in promotion to subsequent levels. Each promotion entitles the player to upgrade one of the skills present in the inventory. In addition, each wave of enemies lasts only a few seconds, and after its completion, the player selects a trait (the so-called “upgrade”) that will further strengthen the incoming enemies in the next wave (e.g. increase their speed, attack power or endurance). This mechanism affects the gradual increase of the difficulty level, which in turn translates into increasing dynamics of the gameplay.

After successfully surviving all waves on a given map, a boss appears. Defeating it results in unlocking the next, more challenging location with stronger opponents, and also allows you to acquire more valuable items. After that, the player returns to the hideout, where he can review the obtained equipment, make the necessary changes in equipment and prepare for further exploration.

Main Gameplay Assumptions.
- **Character Movement**: The player moves with the WSAD keys for intuitive control in a 3D isometric environment.
- **Equipment System**: The player has his own equipment, which can be modified and upgraded, affecting stats and available skills.
- **Skills**: The character has a variety of skills that can be developed as he gains experience and advances in levels. Skills are targeted with the mouse - the player indicates the direction or location in which they are to be used, but their activation is automatic when the cooldown expires.
- **Enemy waves**: The main gameplay is based on eliminating waves of monsters that attack the player with increasing intensity.
- **Enemy upgrade mechanism**: After each wave, the player chooses one of the available upgrades that increase the difficulty of subsequent waves by modifying the behavior and stats of enemies.
- **Bosses and map progression**: After defeating all waves on a given map, a boss appears, whose defeat unlocks a higher, more challenging map with stronger opponents.
